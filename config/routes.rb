#@ MAtt, if we want to add :booking to resources :restaurants only then we should do it outside
# since only only works for the basic 7 methods
# put inside member cause it needs to be linkee to the restaurant ID
# collection =   url/restaurant/booking
# member     =   url/restaurant/id/booking

# Namespace allows for a sub folder with multiple controllers inside app/controllers so that
# you can seperate the code for the controller based on their goals.
